    description: |
      The `:switch` control evaluates an array of conditions and executes the routine defined by the `:then` key of the first item for which the `:case` key evaluates to `true`. If no condition evaluates to `true`, the routine defined in the `default` key is executed.
    controlKeys: |
      - `:switch: array`: __Required__
          - `:case: boolean`: __Required__ - The boolean result of a test.
          - `:then: routine`: __Required__ - The routine to execute if the test is `true`.
      - `:default: routine`:  The routine to execute if all the `:case` tests are `false`.
